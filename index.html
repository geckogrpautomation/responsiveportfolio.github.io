                    <p>
                    I grew up in the SE of Melbourne. After leaving school I started an electrical appreticeship. For most of my training I was building and assisting in designing
                    control systems, water dosing systems, industrial telemtry & networks plus remote access solutions. I cut my teeth here and after my initial ,certificate was completed 
                    I went on to complete a further certificate in automation. After doing many industry based PLC and SCADA courses and a lot of on the job coding experience I decided to
                    complete some more formalised training in SQL databases. I also have completed TCP/IP network training on Layer 2 and Layer 3 integration to provide low latency 
                    networks for industrial machinery needing these types of speeds, including robotics, motions control systems and any real time based requirements.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    In order to remain current and to live my motto of life long learning; I now here on my way to complete the Monash Bootcamp Program.
